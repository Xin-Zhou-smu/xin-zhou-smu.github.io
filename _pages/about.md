My name is Xin Zhou, a four-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Singapore Management University (SMU). I am very honored and fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) and be a member of [SOAR](https://soarsmu.github.io/). Previously, I got my Bachelor degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](http://www.bit.edu.cn/)

Education
======
* B.S. in Automation Engineering (a sub-major of Electronic Engineering), Beijing Institute of Technology, Aug. 2016 -- Jun. 2020
* Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science, Singapore Management University, Aug. 2020 -- Dec. 2024 (expected)


Research Interest
======
My research interest mainly lies in:
* Understanding the ability of large language models of code (Code LLM) (ICSME'21, ICPC'23, ESEC/FSE'23, ASE'23);
* Enhancing the ability of large language models of code (Code LLM) (ICSME'23, TOSEM'23, TSE'23).
