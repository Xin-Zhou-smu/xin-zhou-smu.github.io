My name is Xin Zhou, and I am currently a Research Scientist (equivalent to a Postdoctoral Fellow) in Software Engineering at [Singapore Management University (SMU)](https://www.smu.edu.sg/), under the supervision of [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/).

I received my Ph.D. in January 2025 from the School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University, where I had the great honor of working with [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) and being a member of [SOAR](https://soarsmu.github.io/). Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](http://www.bit.edu.cn/).



Education
======
* B.S. in Automation Engineering, Beijing Institute of Technology, August 2016 -- July 2020
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, Singapore Management University, 2025 August 2020 -- January 2025. 


Research Interest
======
My research interest mainly lies in:
* Understanding the ability of large language models of code (ICSME'21, ICPC'23, ESEC/FSE'23, ASE'23);
* Enhancing the ability of large language models of code (ICSME'23, TOSEM'23, TSE'23, ICSE'24).
