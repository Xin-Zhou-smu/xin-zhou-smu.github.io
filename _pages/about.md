My name is Xin Zhou, a four-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Singapore Management University (SMU). I am very honored and fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. David Lo](http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) and be a member of [SOAR] (https://soarsmu.github.io/). Previously, I got my Bachelor degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)](http://www.bit.edu.cn/)
