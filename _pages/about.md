My name is Xin Zhou, a final-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Singapore Management University (SMU). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. David Lo] (http://www.mysmu.edu/faculty/davidlo/) and be a memeber of [SOAR] (). Previously, I got my Bachelor degree from [Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT)] (http://www.bit.edu.cn/)
